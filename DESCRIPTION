Title: Tools for simplifying basic demographic tables
Description: A method that reduces the time and amount of code required to create basic demographic tables. The demotable function handles both factor variables, returning a table with the N and relative % reported for each factor, and numeric variables, returning a table with basic descriptive statistics such as mean median, sd, etc. for each variable. Basic descriptive stats in demotables depends on the psych package, and adds to it's output standard error (95% confidence interval).
