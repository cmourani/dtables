Description: Functions that reduce the time and amount of code required to create basic
    demographic frequencies tables. The dtable function handles both factor variables,
    returning a table with the N and relative % reported for each factor, and numeric
    variables, returning a table with basic descriptive statistics such as mean, median,
    sd, etc. for each variable. Descriptive stats for numeric variables depends on the
    describe function from the psych package.
